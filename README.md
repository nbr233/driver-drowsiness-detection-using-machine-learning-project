# ðŸš— Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning and Computer Vision-based project to detect driver drowsiness in real time using facial landmark detection and classification algorithms. The main goal is to help prevent road accidents caused by driver fatigue by alerting them when signs of drowsiness are detected.
